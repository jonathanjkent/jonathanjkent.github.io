## Theoretical Framework

- Nativism is central to the modern far right, and it's ideology holds that race, gender, and other inequalities are natural and even positive (Mudde 2007, 2019).

- Contact theory research has demonstrated that such prejudicial views toward out-groups can be reduced though interaction (Pettigrew et al. 2011).

- Certain forms of urban design promote more contact between neighbors than others (Jacobs 1961, Gehl 2011).

- Implication: In some cities there should be more interaction, less prejudice, and less support for the far right.

---

## Framework: Far Right

- We are now in the fourth wave of the rise of the far right in Europe (Mudde 2019).

- At the individual level, research explaining this rise has focused on economic and cultural grievance hypotheses, with mixed results (Golder 2016).

- These same hypotheses have been applied to the social context, operationalized as unemployment rates and migrant populations (e.g.  Georgiadou et al. 2018).

- Most of the literature stays within this competition framework, though there are interesting exceptions (e.g. Bolet 2021).

---

## Framework: Contact Theory

- There is a very large literature that direct contact reduces prejudice (Pettigrew et al. 2011).

- However, newer literature on </i>extended</i> contact is particularly interesting (Zhou et al. 2018).

- People whose friends have out-group friends are less likely to be prejudiced.

- People who observe, but don't participate in, intergroup contact are also less likely to be prejudiced.

- At the scale of a city, the potential impact is enormous.

---

## Framework: Urban Theory

- Modernist design trends inserted openness into previously continuous urban fabric throughout the 20th century.

- Two dueling philosophies argued that cities should expand horizontally (urban sprawl) or vertically (set-back residential high-rises). For both, grass and light was essential.

- Jacobs (1961) famously sounded the alarm that these trends were degrading the vitality of cities, reducing interaction between neighbors.

- EEA's CORINE Land Cover data distinguishes between </i>continuous urban fabric</i> and </i>discontinuous urban fabric</i> which broadly captures the dichotomy between compact, traditional designs and modernist, open ones.

---

## Hypotheses

- H1: Residents of cities with more continuous urban fabric will be less likely to have sympathy for far-right parties.

- H2: The negative relationship between continuous urban fabric and far-right sympathy will be stronger in cities with larger relative migrant populations.

---

## Case Selection & Data

- I study a single country, to reduce variation in political context and maximize data availability and consistency.

- Vox is very similar to other radical-right parties in Europe, especially in its anti-immigrant and anti-feminism stances (Gould 2019, Arcila Calder√≥n et al. 2020, Bernardez-Rodal et al. 2020).

- At the individual level, data comes from 12 pooled CIS barometer surveys from January 2019 to March 2020, which ask respondents how likely they are to support Vox on a 0 (never) to 10 (always) scale. The dichotomous outcome variable treats response 1-10 as *sympathy for the far right*.

- City-level data is provided by Eurostat.

---

## Methods

- Hypotheses are tested using Bayesian multilevel logistic regression models fitted with rstanarm.

- Models include urban fabric, population, and density, as well as variables common to the literature: unemployment rate, migrant population, and change in migrant population. All city-level variables are coded as one-standard-deviation z-scores.

- At the individual level, I include age, age<sup>2</sup>, gender, religion, education, and occupation variables. I model separate intercepts for all categorical variables.

- I also account for variation in the political context by including survey date as a continuous variable and CCAA as a level.

## Conclusions

- The explanatory literature on far-right support should shift its focus from the economic grievance vs. cultural grievance debate. As this paper and Bolet (2021) show, there is much more to the social context.

- We may focus too much on immigration issues, as well. The far right seeks to perpetuate many other inequalities, especially gender.

- Social scientists should give more consideration to urban fabric. Climate change will force us to redesign our cities again, and we need to be part of the conversation.
