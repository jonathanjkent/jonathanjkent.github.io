In November 2023, I successfully defended my dissertation on the impact of urban design on the attitudes and behaviors of city dwellers.

Urban design influences how we go about our lives and even how we feel about our neighbors. Using data from the Copernicus Urban Atlas, I find that residents of cities across Europe that have more continuous urban fabric are more likely to think that foreigners are good for their city. I argue that contact theory and the writing of Jane Jacobs can explain this relationship: compact design encourages neighborly interaction which, in turn, encourages inclusivity. To further test this framework, I compare 73 cities in Spain and find that those who live in cities with more continuous urban fabric are less likely to support the far right. Not only can social scientists use the Copernicus Urban Atlas to study attitudes, they can use it to predict behavior, too. In the final chapter, I demonstrate that models based on its data can improve on the classic gravity model of human mobility.
